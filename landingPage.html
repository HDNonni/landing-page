            <p>Important information to know before purchasing house plans! If you’re buying house plans online, you should
                know that many online stock home plan companies sell inferior plans that do not include all the necessary
                information needed to safely build your home.</p>

            <p>The details of your construction drawings are critical to ensure that your new home is built using proper
                structural and building methods.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Important details to consider:

                        The Spruce.com, </a></span>Rebuilding wins Long-Term by resetting the clock, but if money is an issue
                then remodeling may be the way to go. However, you may not get all you want but you can take control of how
                much you spend. If you want better , tear down and rebuild but if you want cheaper then remodel.

                    <li>The ultimate condition of the house</li>
                    <li>Can desired improvements be contained within the existing house footprint.</li>
                    <li>Foundation is bad and requires a lot of work before the house can be remodeled.</li>
                    <li>Community Restrictions</li>
                    <li>A 4-6 month temporary housing</li>

            <div id="newUsed">As outlined at <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/062614/should-you-buy-or-build-home.asp">Investopedia.com</a>,there
                are 2 advantages of buying an existing home; cost and convenience, however alternately a big disadvantage
                is that you may not get exactly what you want.
                <p> Building lends to more modern artchitecture, energy efficiency , new materials and it is less likely
                    to have health concerns due to toxic materials that may exist is a older house.</p>
                <p>uilding up front cost may be higher , however there is a greater chance of recouping that cost in a resale.</p>
                <p>Money and features aside, building a house can lead to a level of satisfaction that you can't achieve
                    through buying an existing home. In either case, working with a qualified and experienced professional
                    – whether that's a real estate agent or a general contractor – can help ensure the process goes as smoothly
                    as possible.</p>
